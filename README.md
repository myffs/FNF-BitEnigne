A engine that made a OG mod [Vs shrek 6 DEMO ](https://github.com/LilDrippyMyFnf/Vs-Shrek-6-DEMO),this engine is really bad,yeah,really bad

Also,dont get carried away cause of how fucking bad the engine is.

this engine is `constantly changing,`but NOT every day you expect a update.
i'm testing out new vanilla features so the old stuff is being `reworked`
